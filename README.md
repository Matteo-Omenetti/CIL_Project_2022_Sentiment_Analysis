## Running instruction

### Preprocessing


### W2V

### RNN
The notebook that was used to obtain the RNN results contains all exectuted cells. To rerun the notebook all the Preprocessing and W2V notebooks must have been executed before hand. Moreover the following references:

```python
DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CIL/Dataset/{}'

# constants and global variables
PROBABILITIES = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CIL/Probabilities /{}'
DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CIL/Dataset/{}'
PREDICTIONS = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CIL/Predictions/{}'
MODEL_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CIL/Models/{}'
```
Should be changed adequately to reflect the file path of the machine running the notbook.
